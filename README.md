# BasilOS

[OpenSimulator] region module for generating content for a [Basil viewer].
This is early code development so things are being tried out.
Eventually there will be explanatory and configuration information here.

**NOTE**: As of JUne 15, 2017, development of OAR file conversion has moved to
the [Convoar] repository. Work will move back to this repository when that is
complete and I start on the viewer interface appliction.
